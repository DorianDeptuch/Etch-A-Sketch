# Etch-A-Sketch


I managed to work out a lot of the project myself with some googling. My original Javascript file had a O(n2) big O notation happening according to vince. Vince helped clean up my code a lot which caused it to lag a lot less. I started implementing the multi color code but couldn't find a way to make a button to implement it. maybe for the future, i'll find a way to do that, as well as the sketch opacity thing and an erase function. I found out about the <input type=color through the student solutions and after some googling, i was able to make that work. I'm going to call this project done at this point. I might come back to work on it in the future.
  
Update (12/2021): After doing some cleaning and editing of old projects to put ont GitHub, I revisited the code and cleaned a lot of the functions up. I made the previous functions

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Foundation Course.
