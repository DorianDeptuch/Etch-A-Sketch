# Etch-A-Sketch
managed to work out a lot of the project myself with some googling. My original Javascript file had a O(n2) big O notation happening according to vince. Vince helped clean up my code a lot which caused it to lag a lot less. I started implementing the multi color code but couldn't find a way to make a button to implement it. maybe for the future, i'll find a way to do that, as well as the sketch opacity thing and an erase function. I found out about the <input type=color through the student solutions and after some googling, i was able to make that work. I;m going to call this project done at this point. I might come back to work on it in the future.
